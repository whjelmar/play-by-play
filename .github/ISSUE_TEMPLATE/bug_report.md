1. Severe - `sports_photography_workflow_creation` is unable to operate or caused other critical software to fail and there is no acceptable way to work around the problem. This condition requires an immediate solution.

2. Moderate - Significant impact.  sports_photography_workflow_creation` is usable but is limited. Work around exists, but requires significant effort. Incomplete/incorrect documentation, poor or unexplained log messages where no clear error was evident, side effect is observed which does not significantly harm operations etc.

3. Low - Minimal impact. Issue is an annoyance, but I can get work done. This indicates the problem causes little impact on operations or that a reasonable circumvention to the problem has been implemented. Usability quirks, requires minor documentation updates, or could be enhance with some minor changes to the function.
