<h2>
<center>The Event File</center>
</h2>
<p><font size="+1">The event files contain game descriptions using
the Retrosheet scoring system. This page will describe the scoring
system in sufficient detail to allow working with these full
play-by-play descriptions.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The files
containing the play-by-play data follow a naming convention.
Each file has one team's home games and has a name of the form YYYYTTT.EVX.
In this format, YYYY is the four digit year and TTT
is a three character team code. The zip archive downloaded
contains a file named TEAMYYYY that contains the team codes and
team names in the particular season. Each file contains the home games in chronological order for the specified team.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Files are ASCII text files consisting of a series
of records. Each record is a single line starting with a type
designator and ending with the DOS new line sequence (newline,
carriage return characters).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For each game as many as eleven different record
types may be used. Each record type has a unique designator, which is
followed by several fields separated by commas. These are discussed
in detail below.
</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The record type is not considered to be a field
and starts in column 1. Following the record type are the record
fields which are separated from the record type and each other by
commas ' , '.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Field data such as names are normally enclosed in
double quotes ' " '. Commas used in quoted fields are not field
separators.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><a name="2"></a>Retrosheet player id. All players
are represented by a code that is unique for each player. This 8
character code is constructed from the first four letters of the
player's last name, the first initial of his common name, and a three
digit number. If a player's last name is less than 4 characters long
a dash "-" is used as a placeholder. Numbers starting with 0 are used
for players appearing in games in or after 1983. Players completing
their careers before 1983 are assigned numbers starting with 100.
</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1">joner002 is the Retrosheet player id for
Ruppert Jones.</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"><i>id</i> Each game begins with a twelve character
ID record which identifies the date, home team, and number of the
game. For example, ATL198304080 should be read as follows. The first
three characters identify the home team (the Braves). The next four
are the year (1983). The next two are the month (April) using the
standard numeric notation, 04, followed by the day (08). The last
digit indicates if this is a single game (0), first game (1) or
second game (2) if more than one game is played during a day, usually
a double header The <i>id</i> record starts the description of a game
thus ending the description of the preceding game in the
file.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><font size="+1">id,ATL198304080</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"><i>version</i> The version record is next, but is
obsolete and can be ignored.</font></p>
<blockquote style="font-family: monospace;"><font size="+1">version,1</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"><i>info</i> There are up to 34 info records, each
of which contains a single piece of information, such as the
temperature, attendance, identity of each umpire, etc. The record
format is info,type,data . The complete list of </font><a href="#1"><font
 size="+1">info
record types</font></a><font size="+1"> is given below.</font></p>
<blockquote style="font-family: monospace;"><font size="+1">info,attendance,32737</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"><i>start </i> and <i>sub</i> There are 18 (for the
NL and pre-DH AL) or 20 (for the AL with the DH) start records, which
identify the starting lineups for the game. Each start or sub record
has five fields. The sub records are used when a player is replaced
during a game. The roster files that accompany the event files
include throwing and batting handedness information.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. The first field is the </font><a href="#2"><font
 size="+1">Retrosheet
player id</font></a><font size="+1">, which is unique for each
player.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. The second field is the player's name.
</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. The next field is either 0 (for visiting team),
or 1 (for home team). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. The next field is the position in the batting
order, 1 - 9. When a game is played using the DH rule the pitcher is
given the batting order position 0. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5. The last field is the fielding position. The
numbers are in the standard notation, with designated hitters being
identified as position 10. On sub records 11 indicates a pinch hitter
and 12 is used for a pinch runner.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1">start,richg001,"Gene Richards",0,1,7</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"><i>play</i> The play records contain the events of
the game. Each play record has 7 fields. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. The first field is the inning, an integer
starting at 1.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. The second field is either 0 (for visiting
team) or 1 (for home team). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. The third field is the </font><a href="#2"><font
 size="+1">Retrosheet
player id</font></a><font size="+1"> of the player at the plate.
</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. The fourth field is the count on the batter
when this particular event (play) occurred. Most Retrosheet games do
not have this information, and in such cases, "??" appears in this
field. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5. The fifth field is of variable length and
contains all pitches to this batter in this plate appearance and is
</font><a href="#3"><font size="+1">described
below</font></a><font size="+1">. If pitches are unknown, this field
is left empty, nothing is between the commas.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">6. The sixth field describes the play or event
that occurred. </font></p>
<blockquote style="font-family: monospace;"><font size="+1">play,5,1,ramir001,00,,S8.3-H;1-2</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">A play record ending in a number sign, #,
indicates that there is some uncertainty in the play. Occasionally, a
com record may follow providing additional information. A play record
may also contain exclamation points, "!" indicating an exceptional
play and question marks "?" indicating some uncertainty in the play.
These characters can be safely ignored.</font></p>
<blockquote style="font-family: monospace;"><font size="+1">play,3,1,kearb001,??,,PB.2-3#<br>
com,"Not sure if PB, may have been balk"</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The event is the most complex of all the fields
and is </font><a href="#5"><font size="+1">described in detail
below</font></a><font size="+1">.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>badj </i> This record is used to mark a plate
appearance in which the batter bats from the side that is not
expected ("badj" means "batting adjustment"). The syntax
is:</font></p>
<blockquote style="font-family: monospace;"><font size="+1">badj,playerid,hand</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The expectation is defined by the roster file.
There are two general cases in which this is used:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. Many switch-hitters bat right-handed against
right-handed knuckle ball pitchers even though the default assumption
is that they would be batting left-handed.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><span style="font-family: monospace;">badj,bonib001,R</span></font></blockquote>
<font size="+1">indicates that switch-hitter Bobby Bonilla was batting
right-handed against a right-handed pitcher.</font><br>
<p><font size="+1">2. Occasionally a player will be listed in a
roster as batting "R" or "L" but will bat the other way. For example,
Rick Dempsey did this 13 times in 1983. The syntax this is:
badj,dempr101,L</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>padj</i> This record covers the very rare case
in which a pitcher pitches to a batter with the hand opposite the one
listed in the roster file. To date this has only happened once, when
Greg Harris of the Expos, a right-hander, pitched left-handed to two
Cincinnati batters on 9-28-1995. The syntax is parallel to that for
the badj record: </font><font size="+1"><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">padj,harrg001,L</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>ladj</i> This record is used when teams bat out
of order.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>radj</i> This record is used in games from 2020 in which an extra inning
begins with a runner on 2nd</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>data</i> Data records appear after all play
records from the game. At present, the only data type, field 2, that
is defined specifies the number of earned runs allowed by a pitcher.
Each such record contains the pitcher's </font><a href="#2"><font
 size="+1">Retrosheet
player id</font></a><font size="+1"> and the number of earned runs he
allowed. There is a data record for each pitcher that appeared in the
game.</font></p>
<blockquote style="font-family: monospace;"><font size="+1">data,er,showe001,2</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"><i>com</i> The final record type is used primarily
to add explanatory information for a play. However, it may occur
anywhere in a file. The second field of the com record is
quoted.</font></p>
<blockquote style="font-family: monospace;"><font size="+1">com,"ML
debut for Behenna"</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">There is a standard record ordering for each game.
An <i>id</i> record starts the description of a particular game. This
is followed by the <i>version</i> and <i>info</i> records. The
<i>start</i> records follow the <i>info</i> records. The game is
described by a series of <i>play</i>, <i>sub</i> and <i>com</i>
records. A <i>sub</i> record is always preceded by a <i>play np</i>
record. <i>data</i> records follow the last <i>play</i> record for
the game. A game description is terminated by an <i>id</i> record
starting another game or the end of the file.</font></p>
<h3><font size="+1"><a name="1"></a>Info record types<br>

<p><font size="+1">Complete records
are shown. <span style="font-style: italic;">info</span> records are
of two general kinds, game-related and

<h3><font size="+1"><a name="5"></a>The event field of the play record</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">The sixth field, event, describes the play which
occurred. This field is variable in length and has three main
portions which define the Retrosheet scoring system. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The first part of an event is a description of the
basic play.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The second part is a modifier for the first part
and is separated from it with a forward slash, "/". In fact, there
may be more than one modifier. A typical use of modifiers is to
specify </font><a href="https://www.retrosheet.org/location.htm"><font
 size="+1">hit
locations</font></a><font size="+1">. For example, "D8/78" indicates
a double fielded by the center fielder on a ball hit to left center.
A complete list of modifiers excepting hit locations </font><a

given below</font></a><font size="+1">. When more than one modifier
is used, each is introduced by a "/".</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The third part describes the advance of any
runners, separated from the earlier parts by a period. A successful
advance is indicated by a dash, "-". An out made while advancing is
indicated by an X. 2-3 indicates a runner has advanced from second to
third on the play. 1X2 indicates the runner was out at second
advancing from first. If a base runner is not listed as advancing he
remains on the base he was on. In some cases lack of advance is
indicated explicitly by an advance starting and ending on the same
base such as 3-3 . When put outs are made on base runners the advance
field indicates fielding data and errors if they occur. See below for
a </font><a href="#4"><font size="+1">complete description for
advances</font></a><font size="+1">. Note that any advances after the
first are separated by semicolons.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For example, the event "S9/L9S.2-H;1-3" should be
read as: single fielded by the right fielder, line drive to short
right field. The runner on 2nd scored (advanced to home), and the
runner on first advanced to third.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Many event descriptions require information in the
form of numbers. The meaning of a particular number depends on where
it appears in the event. For the descriptions that follow the
following notation will be used:</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1">Fielders will be represented by a number in
the range 1 (pitcher) to 9 (right fielder) using a dollar sign, "$".
When two $ symbols are used, $$, this is understood to mean a sequence
of two or more fielders.</font>
  <p><font size="+1">Bases are represented by a percent sign, "%",
representing one of five characters, 1, 2 and 3 for first through
third; B or H for home. B is used when a batter advance must be
explicitly given. Scoring is indicated by an advance that reaches home,
H.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Many examples of plays scored using the Retrosheet
system will be given in this document. For some interesting and
extreme cases check the Retrosheet </font><a

<p><font size="+1">The example plays have been chosen to illustrate
how events are coded. Some of these events are exceedingly
rare.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There is occasionally more than one event for each
plate appearance, such as stolen bases, wild pitches, and balks in
which the same batter remains at the plate. On these occasions the
pitch sequence is interrupted by a period, and there is another play
record for the resumption of the batter's plate
appearance.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For purposes of description, it is convenient to
separate the event types into two categories: those involving the

<hr>ladj. This record is used when teams bat out of order. The normal
assumption is that proper lineup sequence is followed, therefore, it
is necessary to have some special indication when this is violated.
The format is:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">where "hv" is 0 for visiting or 1 for the home
team and "pos" is 1-9 for the batting order position. Retrosheet has
discovered quite a few cases of batting out of turn. You can see them

The format is:</font></p>
<blockquote style="font-family: monospace;"><font size="+1">radj,playerid,base</font></blockquote>

<hr>Replay
Instant replay of home run calls was instituted on 8/28/2008. It was expanded at the start of the 2014 
season to include many other types of plays. For a more complete explanation and list all replays, see 
the following two pages.

https://www.retrosheet.org/ReplayHR.htm
https://www.retrosheet.org/Replay.htm

Each time the replay system is used, a slash tag is added to the play string. This will be /UREV for an 
umpire-initiated review and /MREV for a manager challenge. Immediately after that play there will be a 
comment record with details of the replay/challenge. The fields in this string are:

com,"replay,inning,Batter ID,Batter Team ID,Umpire ID,Ballpark ID,Reason,Reversed,Initiator,Team,Type

Ejections

Each time someone is ejected by an umpire, there will be multiple comments about the incident. This 
ejected person could be a player, coach, manager, trainer, mascot or fan. The first line will contain

Umpire changes during games

Occasionally, an umpire will be injured or develop an illness during a game. When there are changes to 
the umpire alignment during a game, there will be multiple comments with standardized fields to 
describe the change.

com,"umpchange,Inning,Position,Umpire ID"
   umpchange: standard text
   Inning: the inning in which the change took place
   Position:
      umphome

      ump2b
      ump3b
      umplf
      umprf
   Umpire ID: the umpire who changed positions
The following comment will contain a text description of the incident.

Protests

When a manager protests an umpire ruling to the league office, a comment is added to the game to 
indicate the details of that protest. This comment is usually at the start of the game.

com,"Protest=Code"
   Code
      P - unidentified team
      V - disallowed protest by visiting team
      H - disallowed protest by home team
      X - upheld protest by visiting team

<hr>
Suspensions

When a game is suspended by weather or other conditions, a comment is added to the game to indicate 
the details of the suspension. This comment is usually at the start of the game.

com,"Suspend=YYYYMMDD,ParkID,Vis,Home,Outs"
    YYYYMMDD - completion date
    ParkID: if the game was resumed in another park from where it started
    Vis - visitor score at time of suspension
    Home - Home score at time of suspension
    Outs - Length of game in outs at time of suspension
